        <h3 align="center">WHAT IS AUTONOMOUS ETHICS?</h3>
        <p>Autonomous Ethics is program that focuses on the moral and ethical decisions around the autonomous vehicle industry.
            Autonomous Ethics was developed as a final-year undergraduate Computer Science project.</p>

        <h3 align="center">WHAT ARE AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES?</h3>
        <p>Autonomous cars are a growing industry, with the industry movement recently gaining more notice due to accomplishments and innovations by both Tesla and Google. The end goal of autonomous vehicle development is, in concept, to build a vehicle that can function without the need for a driver.
            Autonomy is something that other leading manufacturers (General Motors, Mercedes, BMW, etc.) are also currently developing.</p>

        <h3 align="center">CURRENT TECHNOLOGY</h3>
        <p>In history, the very first driverless cars began to surface in the late 70s and 80s, however technology has come a long way since then. Even though cars are not fully autonomous as of yet (such a milestone is not expected for another decade or so), semi-autonomous vehicles are already widespread.
            Many of today’s modern cars utilize technology for many of their features, e.g. vehicle sensors, navigation, adaptive cruise control, self-parking, etc.</p>
        <p>However, features that have been developed recently are still in the midst of a struggle. A driverless car’s detection system, used for road-tracking and accident prevention, does not currently work 100% of the time.
            Civilian/vehicle detection is unpredictable at best, and the crash-testing of these vehicles has deemed them to be unsafe.</p>

        <h3 align="center">THE PROBLEMS WITH AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest issues with autonomous vehicles is the moral and ethical gymnastics that professionals in the industry have been struggling with for years. More specifically, in the event of an unavoidable accident, what sort of decision should the car make? In most cases, the problem is described as the car having to make an ultimate decision – in essence, who should live or die?
            Seeing as the morals behind such decisions vary so much from person to person, it is currently one of the biggest reserves that experts have in regards to the future of autonomy.</p>
        <p>In a recent study, it was revealed that most people do not like the concept of driverless cars. However, these people are okay with semi-automatic features such as those listed above.</p>

        <h3 align="center">WHAT AUTONOMOUS ETHICS DOES</h3>
        <p>Autonomous Ethics exists more for research purposes. We wanted to explore peoples’ thinking patterns when it comes to significant ethical/moral decision-making. In our project, we have added a vast amount of variety to allow us to gather a much wider range of results. Autonomous Ethics presents the user with a randomly generated scenario.
        <p>The scenario goes as follows: A driverless car (passengers are present) is approaching a zebra crossing.
        The brakes of the car are no longer functional, and an accident is unavoidable. There are two groups of people on the crossing. The moral dilemma here is left in the user’s hands – they must make a choice which could result in the serious injury or even death of some of the people on the crossing, or the passengers of the car itself.</p>
            <p>The generator adapts to your decisions and provides scenarios appropriate to them.</p>

        <h3 align="center">OUR THOUGHTS ON AUTONOMOUS CARS</h3>
            <p>“It's a good idea but it's too soon to trust an autonomous car to make an ethical decision when put in an unethical situation as there isn’t necessarily a right or wrong answer.
                The better solution would be to have the car understand what kind of a decision the driver would make and make a decision based on that.” – Kieran</p>
            <p>“I think there should be a test of the driver beforehand and understand their psychology and decision-making process, so the car can make decisions correlated on their decision patterns.” – James</p>
            <p>“Autonomous vehicles have the potential to be the future of transport, that much can’t be argued with – it’s a case of how we get to that future that we need to worry about.
                It’s impossible to localize an autonomous vehicle’s moral code to a specific area, country, or culture. In a world where everyone’s opinions and views are different, finding a middle ground will be the most substantial challenge that experts face.” – Taylor</p>
            <p>“I believe that autonomous vehicles are quite pointless; I do think that it potentially could be helpful for public transport, but that would be far into the future as I believe a lot of work still needs doing in order to implement it.
                From the research I've carried out on the autonomous car, the biggest dilemma surrounding them was debating giving them the power to choose what should happen if a car crash was to happen, and I believe that no one but yourself has the authority to influence the outcome.” - Ibraheem</p>
